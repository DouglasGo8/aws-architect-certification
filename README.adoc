.AWS Timeline

. AWS enables you to build sophisticated and scalable applications
. How to choose AWS Regions: its depends
.. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a regions without your explicit permission
.. Proximity to reduce latency
.. Kinds of available services within a Region
.. Pricing all check price

. AWS Common Global Services

* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Route 53 (DNS Service)
* Cloud Front (Content Delivery Network)
* WAF (Web Application Firewall)

. AWS Services Common Region Services

* AWS EC2 (IaaS)
* Elastic Beans Talk (PaaS)
* Lambda (FaaS)

=== IAM & Fundamentals

* IAM (_Identity and Access Management_) is as global service, identities can be classified as humans and non-humans
* Root account created by default, but never ever should be used or shared
* Users are people within an organization, and must be grouped
* Groups only contain users, not other groups
* Always apply the [.underline]#*_least privilege principle_*#, that means, don't give more or any permissions that a user really needs
* Policies in a group will be applied in everyone inside this group

* #IAM Roles for Services#, assign permissions to AWS Services with IAM Roles, e.g., some EC2 instance needs access Lambda
* Instance Profile: works such as box for an iam role, can be used to pass role information to an EC2 instance, will be automatically created when a role is attached in EC2 Instance
* Identity-based vs Resource-based policies: policies attached to services, e.g.: Bucket ACL, by default, only the account owner has access to S3 bucket, here we can classify as Identity, as Resource-based is a role attached to a service (S3)
* IAM Cross Account: when a different account needs to perform some actions in your account
* IAM Roles are classified as:
** _AWS Services_: Allow AWS services like EC2, Lambda or other to perform actions in this account, most common use cases are EC2 and Lambda
** _AWS Account_: Allow entities in other AWS accounts belonging to you or 3rd party to perform actions in this account
** _Web Identity_: Allows users federated by the specified external web identity provider to assume this role to perform actions in this account
** _SAML 2.0 federation_: Allow users federated with SAML 2.0 from a corporate directory to perform actions in this account
** _Custom trust policy_: Create a custom trust policy to enable others to perform actions in this account

* Quick summary for IAM

- Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
- Groups: contains only users
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
- Roles: for AWS EC2 instances or AWS Services
- Security: MFA + Password Policy
- Grant Least Privilege
- IAM Credentials Report is a Security Tool

=== EC2 Fundamentals

* Used in everywhere and means Elastic Compute Cloud
* Composed by many definitions such as:
. Virtual Machines (Ec2 Instances),
. Storing data (EbS & EfS)
. Distributing loads across machines (ElB)
. Scaling the instances using auto-scaling group (ASG)

. EC2 Instance types: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types[Ec2 Instance Types], we can check specific instances vantages on https://instances.vantage.sh[Instances Vantages]

* Security Group plays a critical role over AWS network, they control how the traffic (firewall) is allowed into or out of our EC2 instance, sg (security groups) can be also referenced between them using inbound/outbound concepts

* *_Never ever_*, runs *_aws configure_* inside an EC2 instance *NEVER*, instead of use IAM Policies

=== Private vs Public Network (IPv4)

* Networking in AWS can define IPs over IPv4 and/or IPv6; IPv4 _1.160.10.240_ - IPv6 _3ff3:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67c7_
* In private Network, all the computers / servers can talk to one another using private IPs, after attaching IGW Internet Gateway,__ these server instances can talk with public internet

.IGW Public Communication
image::thumbs/images/aws_private_network.png[]

* Public IP must be unique across the whole internet
* Private IP can be identified and used only inside a private network
* EC2 has ephemeral ip, but we can use elastic ip to keep the same value
* In general *_don't use Elastic IPs_*

=== Placement Groups

* Control EC2 Instances (Same Rack, hardware, and Same AZ) using some different strategies such as _Cluster_, _Spread_ and _Partition._
* Cluster low-network latency but need willing to take the risk when the rack fails, all the instances will stop also
* Spread low fail risk over split instances among AZs, but have limitation to 7 instances per AZ
* Partition instances in multiples instances but not all isolated

=== Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)

* Logical components in a VPC that represents a virtual network card, eth0 attached in an EC2 instance, with one or secondary IPv4, mac address

* Which scenario we need a 2 ENIs with private IPS?
The same application in multiple instances can be accessed using two different ENIs, but ENis cannot be attached across AZs

* AWS Organization

. SCPs or *_Service control policy_* is a type of control policy that you can use to centrally control the maximum available *permissions granularity* for all accounts over an organization unit (OU)

* Control Tower stays on the top of the organization and provides you some additional control, it integrates with a Directory Source over Single Sign On with SAML 2.0 or Microsoft AD, detective guardrails are used to governance and compliance

=== Identity & Federation

==== IAM

* Over EC2 instance roles: use the _EC2 metadata_ service.
One role at a time per instance

* Role is a short-term credentials, uses STS
* Policies AWS Managed, Customer Managed or Inline
* Resources Based Policies (S3 Bucket, etc..)

* Best Practice: use the _least privileges_ pattern for maximized security
** Access Advisor: see permissions granted and when last accessed
** Access Analyser: Analyze resources that are shared with external entity

.IAM Roles vs Resources Based Policies
image::thumbs/images/IAM_Roles_vs_ResourceBasedPolicies.png[]

. Using assume role (user, application or Service), you give up your original permission and take the permissions assigned to the role
. Using resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up any permissions

. Example: User in _Account A_ needs to _scan_ a DynamoDB table in _Account A_ and _dump_ it in a S3 bucket in _Account B_

.. IAM ROLE in account A to allow scan action, after we need also a resource policy on the S3 bucket on account B

==== IAM Analyzer

. Find out which resources are shared externally, delimited by Zone of trust (AWS Boundary)

. Cloudtrail logs are reviewed to generate the policy with the fine-grained permissions and the appropriate Actions and Services

.IAM Analyzer with Policy Generation
image::thumbs/images/IAM_Analyzer_actions.png[]

=== Identity Management and Permissions

* Here we do through the IAM service and all principals must be authenticated, what is a principal, a _person_ or _application_ that can make a request for an action or operation on AWS Resource
* The identity-based policy applies to users and roles; they are JSON permissions policy documents that control what actions an identity can perform
* The resource-based policy applies to AWS resources, are JSON documents also

      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::theBucketXXX"
    }
  ]
}
----

==== Users, Groups, Roles and Policies

* Inside an AWS Account we've all of this, _users_, _groups_, _roles_ and _policy_
* Users gain the *permissions* applied to the group through the policy; with policies we can define _permissions_ for the identities or resources they are associated
* Up to 5000 individual user accounts can be created, users have no permissions by default.
* The main reason to use groups is to apply _permissions_ to users using _policies_;
* Roles are assumed by users, applications and services

==== AWS Security Token STS

.AWS Security Token Service (STS)

===== RBAC and ABAC

* Role-Based Access and Attribute-Based Access Controls, the good method is apply the minimum permissions a user needs, and can be classified such as _Administrator_, _Billing_, _Data Scientist_
