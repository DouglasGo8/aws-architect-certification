* AWS Organization

. SCPs or *_Service control policy_* is a type of control policy that you can use to centrally control the maximum available *permissions granularity* for all accounts over an organization unit (OU)

* After creating this policy, it must be attached over OUs tree; in this case using our tree, ou2 will inherit the same SCP, *_over your tree scenario neither DEV-OU1 nor PROD-OU2 can create ec2:instances different from t2:micro_*

* Control Tower stays on the top of the organization and provides you some additional control, it integrates with a Directory Source over Single Sign On with SAML 2.0 or Microsoft AD, detective guardrails are used to governance and compliance

=== Identity & Federation

==== IAM

* Over EC2 instance roles: use the _EC2 metadata_ service.
One role at a time per instance

* Role is a short-term credentials, uses STS
* Policies AWS Managed, Customer Managed or Inline
* Resources Based Policies (S3 Bucket, etc..)

* Best Practice: use the _least privileges_ pattern for maximized security
** Access Advisor: see permissions granted and when last accessed
** Access Analyser: Analyze resources that are shared with external entity

.IAM Roles vs Resources Based Policies
image::../thumbs/images/IAM_Roles_vs_ResourceBasedPolicies.png[]

. Using assume role (user, application or Service), you give up your original permission and take the permissions assigned to the role
. Using resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up any permissions

. Example: User in _Account A_ needs to _scan_ a DynamoDB table in _Account A_ and _dump_ it in a S3 bucket in _Account B_

.. IAM ROLE in account A to allow scan action, after we need also a resource policy on the S3 bucket on account B

==== IAM Analyzer

. Find out which resources are shared externally, delimited by Zone of trust (AWS Boundary)

. Cloudtrail logs are reviewed to generate the policy with the fine-grained permissions and the appropriate Actions and Services

.IAM Analyzer with Policy Generation
image::../thumbs/images/IAM_Analyzer_actions.png[]

=== Identity Management and Permissions

* Here we do through the IAM service and all principals must be authenticated, what is a principal, a _person_ or _application_ that can make a request for an action or operation on AWS Resource
* The identity-based policy applies to users and roles; they are JSON permissions policy documents that control what actions an identity can perform
* The resource-based policy applies to AWS resources, are JSON documents also

      },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::theBucketXXX"
    }
  ]
}
----

==== Users, Groups, Roles and Policies

* Inside an AWS Account we've all of this, _users_, _groups_, _roles_ and _policy_
* Users gain the *permissions* applied to the group through the policy; with policies we can define _permissions_ for the identities or resources they are associated
* Up to 5000 individual user accounts can be created, users have no permissions by default.
* The main reason to use groups is to apply _permissions_ to users using _policies_;
* Roles are assumed by users, applications and services

==== AWS Security Token STS

===== RBAC and ABAC

* Role-Based Access and Attribute-Based Access Controls, the good method is apply the minimum permissions a user needs, and can be classified such as _Administrator_, _Billing_, _Data Scientist_

=== AWS Directory Services

* Establish an AD connection with AD Connector in AWS account to manage and auth services, _sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML_ or _sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity_ to provider tmp aws resource access

=== Cognito User Pools

* Cognito User Pool, over an external scenario using a connected device through api gtw, in this case a cup is a directory for managing sign-in and sign-up for apps using jwt authentication and validated by a lambda authorizer

* Cognito Identity Pool are used to obtain temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Services

=== Advanced AWS VPC

* What is a region?
Region is a physical location in the world independent of each other commonly geographically distant from each other

.AWS Global Infrastructure

* CIDR blocks are network addresses, e.g; 192.168.0.0 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (8 host bits), first address we have _192.168.0.1_ and last _192.168.0.254_, we can have 16 host bits (65536 addresses)
